===========================
Below is a **practical, ethical checklist of do’s and don’ts** for conducting a **black-box penetration test** on a **small business**. This is written from a professional, defensive security perspective (not how to commit wrongdoing).

---

## ✅ DO’s (Best Practices)

### 1. **Get Explicit Written Authorization**

* Have a **signed Rules of Engagement (RoE)** or permission letter.
* Define:

  * Scope (IP ranges, domains, apps)
  * Time window
  * Allowed techniques
  * Emergency contacts
    👉 Without this, testing is **illegal**, even if intentions are good.

---

### 2. **Limit Scope Carefully**

* Only test **what you are allowed to test**.
* Respect exclusions like:

  * Production databases
  * Third-party systems
  * Payment processors (PCI environments)

Small businesses often have fragile systems — stay controlled.

---

### 3. **Use Recon Like a Real Attacker (But Responsibly)**

Allowed black-box recon usually includes:

* DNS enumeration
* Subdomain discovery
* Port scanning
* OSINT (public info, leaked creds, exposed services)

Log **everything** you do for reporting later.

---

### 4. **Focus on High-Risk, High-Impact Issues**

Prioritize:

* Exposed admin panels
* Weak authentication
* Outdated software
* Default credentials
* Misconfigured cloud services
* Injection flaws (SQLi, command injection)
* Broken access control

Small businesses benefit more from fixing **realistic threats** than obscure edge cases.

---

### 5. **Throttle Your Attacks**

* Rate-limit scans and brute-force attempts.
* Avoid DoS-like behavior.
* Test during approved hours.

If you knock their website offline, you’ve failed the test.

---

### 6. **Prove Exploitation Safely**

* Demonstrate impact **without causing damage**

  * Read-only access
  * Non-destructive payloads
* Use screenshots, logs, or hashes instead of deleting or altering data.

---

### 7. **Report Clearly and Actionably**

Your final report should include:

* Executive summary (non-technical)
* Risk level (Critical / High / Medium / Low)
* Proof of concept
* Business impact
* Clear remediation steps

Small businesses often don’t have security teams — clarity matters.

---

## ❌ DON’Ts (Critical Mistakes)

### 1. **Do NOT Test Without Permission**

Even passive scanning without authorization can:

* Trigger legal action
* Violate laws (CFAA, Computer Misuse Act, etc.)
* Damage trust permanently

---

### 2. **Do NOT Exfiltrate Sensitive Data**

Never download:

* Customer PII
* Financial records
* Password databases
* Emails or private documents

Instead, prove access with minimal evidence.

---

### 3. **Do NOT Use Destructive Payloads**

Avoid:

* Ransomware simulations
* Data deletion
* Service crashes
* Crypto-miners
* Persistence/backdoors (unless explicitly approved)

Black-box ≠ reckless.

---

### 4. **Do NOT Go Outside Scope “Just to See”**

Common violations:

* Testing employee personal accounts
* Touching third-party SaaS
* Attacking shared hosting neighbors

Scope creep can kill a contract and cause legal trouble.

---

### 5. **Do NOT Social Engineer Unless Approved**

Phishing, pretexting, or phone attacks:

* Require **explicit written consent**
* Often need legal and HR approval

Never assume it’s okay.

---

### 6. **Do NOT Use Real Criminal Infrastructure**

Avoid:

* Known malware C2 servers
* Stolen exploit kits
* Tor exit nodes that could flag law enforcement

Use professional, controlled tooling.

---

### 7. **Do NOT Shame or Blame**

In reports or meetings:

* Avoid phrases like “basic mistake” or “negligent”
* Frame findings as **risk reduction opportunities**

Your goal is improvement, not embarrassment.

---

## ⚠️ Extra Advice for Small Businesses

* Expect **outdated systems**
* Expect **poor documentation**
* Expect **shared credentials**
* Expect **no monitoring**

Be patient, conservative, and educational.

---

## 🧠 Professional Rule of Thumb

> **If a real attacker would do it, you can test it —
> but only if the business explicitly agreed you could.**

---

If you want, I can:

* Provide a **sample black-box Rules of Engagement**
* Create a **pentest report template**
* Help you **design a safe testing methodology**
* Tailor this advice for **web apps, networks, or cloud**

Just tell me what you’re testing.
