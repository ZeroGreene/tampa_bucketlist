Below is a **professional, ethical sample offer email** you can send to a small business proposing a **black-box penetration test for $6,000**. It’s written to be clear, non-technical, and trust-building for non-security owners.

Hello [Business Owner’s Name],

I hope you’re doing well. My name is [Your Name], and I’m a cybersecurity professional specializing in practical, real-world security testing for small and growing businesses.

I’m reaching out to propose a **black-box penetration test** for your organization. This type of assessment simulates how an external attacker would attempt to compromise your systems using only publicly available information—the same starting point a real threat actor would have.

### What This Test Includes

For a fixed cost of **$6,000**, the engagement would include:

* External reconnaissance of your internet-facing systems
* Testing of your public website, web applications, and exposed services
* Identification of critical vulnerabilities such as:

  * Weak authentication or access controls
  * Outdated or misconfigured software
  * Exposed administrative interfaces
  * Common web application flaws
* Safe proof-of-concept demonstrations (no disruption to operations)
* A clear, written report with:

  * Executive summary (non-technical)
  * Risk-ranked findings
  * Business impact explanations
  * Step-by-step remediation recommendations

### How We Work

* **No access credentials required** (true black-box testing)
* **No denial-of-service or destructive testing**
* **No data exfiltration or system changes**
* Testing performed only during approved time windows
* All work conducted under a signed authorization agreement

### Why This Matters

Small businesses are increasingly targeted because attackers assume weaker defenses. This assessment helps you understand:

* What an attacker could realistically exploit today
* Which risks matter most to your business
* How to prioritize fixes efficiently without overspending

### Deliverables & Timeline

* Engagement length: **2–3 weeks**
* Final report delivered as a PDF with an optional review call
* Follow-up clarification support included

If this is something you’d like to explore, I’d be happy to schedule a brief call to answer questions and confirm scope before moving forward—no obligation.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to speaking with you.
