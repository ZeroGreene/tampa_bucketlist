### 📌 Notes

* **Sauce vs Dry Rub:** Sauces are wet and coat the wings; rubs are dry seasonings applied directly to the skin.([Flavor365][6])
* Some flavors may be rotated in/out as **limited time offerings** or vary by region/market.([AOL][3])

If you want, I can also list **dipping sauces** (like Ranch, Bleu Cheese, Honey Mustard, etc.) that Wingstop offers separately!
